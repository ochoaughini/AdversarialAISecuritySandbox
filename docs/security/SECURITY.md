# AI Adversarial Sandbox - Security Policy

This document outlines the security principles, architecture, and procedures for the AI Adversarial Sandbox. Security is a paramount concern, integrated from design to deployment and operations.

## 1. Security Principles

- **Security by Design:** Integrate security considerations into every phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC).
- **Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users, services, and components.
- **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect against failure of any single control.
- **Zero Trust:** Do not inherently trust any user, device, or network, regardless of whether it is inside or outside the traditional network perimeter.
- **Transparency & Auditability:** Ensure all significant actions are logged and auditable.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and update security policies and practices based on new threats and vulnerabilities.

## 2. Security Architecture

### 2.1 Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication:**
    - **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (OIDC):** For user authentication, integrating with an Identity Provider (IdP) like Auth0, Okta, or AWS Cognito.
    - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For session management and secure API access. Tokens will have short lifespans and support refresh mechanisms.
    - **API Keys (for programmatic access):** Generated for specific services or integrations, managed with strict access controls and rotation policies.
- **Authorization (RBAC - Role-Based Access Control):**
    - **Granular Permissions:** Define roles (e.g., `Viewer`, `Developer`, `Security Analyst`, `Admin`) with specific permissions for model management, attack execution, results viewing, etc.
    - **Policy Enforcement:** API Gateway and individual microservices will enforce authorization policies.

### 2.2 Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest:**
    - All data stored in databases (PostgreSQL), object storage (S3), and persistent volumes will be encrypted using AES-256 with managed keys (e.g., AWS KMS).
    - AI model weights and training datasets will be encrypted.
- **Encryption in Transit:**
    - All network communication within the platform and with external clients will be secured using TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS).
    - Internal service-to-service communication will also be encrypted (e.g., mTLS in Kubernetes).
- **Data Minimization:** Collect and retain only data essential for the platform's functionality.
- **Data Segregation:** Client data (models, inputs, results) will be logically or physically separated to prevent cross-contamination.
- **Data Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Where possible, sensitive data will be anonymized or pseudonymized.

### 2.3 Network Security

- **Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs):** Deploy all resources within isolated cloud networks.
- **Subnetting:** Segment networks into private and public subnets. Application components will reside in private subnets.
- **Security Groups / Network ACLs:** Strict firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance/resource level.
- **Kubernetes Network Policies:** Define rules for how pods communicate with each other and external endpoints.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protect the API Gateway from common web attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **DDoS Protection:** Leverage cloud provider DDoS protection services (e.g., AWS Shield).
- **Private Endpoints:** Use private endpoints for accessing cloud services where possible.

### 2.4 Application Security

- **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
    - Implement rigorous validation for all user inputs (e.g., using Pydantic schemas) to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, RCE).
    - Sanitize all outputs displayed to users.
- **Secure Coding Practices:**
    - Adhere to OWASP Top 10 guidelines.
    - Use secure libraries and frameworks.
    - Conduct regular code reviews and static/dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST).
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly scan and update third-party libraries to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Secret Management:**
    - Never hardcode secrets in code or configuration files.
    - Use dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
    - Implement secret rotation policies.
- **Container Security:**
    - Use minimal base images.
    - Scan container images for vulnerabilities (e.g., Clair, Trivy).
    - Run containers with non-root users.
    - Enforce resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

## 3. Operations Security

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
    - **Centralized Logging:** Aggregate logs from all services and infrastructure components (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk).
    - **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive audit trails for all user actions and system changes.
    - **Real-time Monitoring:** Use Prometheus/Grafana for system health, performance metrics, and security events.
- **Alerting:** Configure alerts for suspicious activities, security incidents, and system anomalies.
- **Vulnerability Management:**
    - Regular vulnerability scanning of all systems and applications.
    - Timely patching and updates for operating systems, libraries, and applications.
    - Penetration testing by external security experts.
- **Incident Response:**
    - Defined incident response plan with clear roles, responsibilities, and procedures for detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review.
    - Regular incident response drills.
- **Access Control for Operations:** Strict access controls for production environments, leveraging jump boxes, MFA, and strong authentication.

## 4. Compliance

The platform will aim to comply with relevant industry standards and regulations:

- **GDPR / CCPA:** For data privacy and user rights, especially if handling personal data.
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF):** Aligning with best practices for managing risks associated with AI.
- **ISO 27001 / SOC 2:** Adhering to information security management system standards (long-term goal).

## 5. Employee Training and Awareness

- Regular security awareness training for all personnel.
- Specific training for developers on secure coding practices and adversarial AI threats.

This comprehensive security policy ensures the AI Adversarial Sandbox is built and operated with a strong security posture, protecting both the platform and its users' data and models.

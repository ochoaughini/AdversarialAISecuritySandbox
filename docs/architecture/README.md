# AI Adversarial Sandbox - Architecture Overview

## 1. Project Vision and Goals

**Vision:** To build a leading, robust, and scalable platform for the research, development, and testing of AI model robustness against various adversarial attacks. This platform will serve as a critical tool for MLOps teams, security researchers, and enterprises to ensure the trustworthiness and resilience of their AI systems.

**Goals:**
- Provide a modular framework for implementing and evaluating diverse adversarial attacks.
- Support various AI model modalities (e.g., Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Time Series).
- Offer comprehensive metrics and visualizations for attack success and model vulnerability.
- Enable secure and scalable deployment in cloud environments.
- Foster collaboration and reproducible research in adversarial AI.

## 2. Target AI Model Types

The platform will initially focus on the following core AI model types, with extensibility for others:

- **Computer Vision (CV):** Image classification, object detection.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition.
- **Time Series:** Anomaly detection, forecasting.

Future expansion may include audio processing, tabular data models, and reinforcement learning agents.

## 3. Adversarial Attack Types Supported

The platform will support a growing library of adversarial attacks, categorized by their target modality and methodology.

**General Categories:**
- **Evasion Attacks:** Generating adversarial examples to fool models during inference.
- **Poisoning Attacks:** Injecting malicious data into training sets to corrupt models.
- **Model Inversion Attacks:** Reconstructing sensitive training data from model outputs.
- **Membership Inference Attacks:** Determining if specific data points were part of the training set.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Exploiting model vulnerabilities to degrade performance or availability.

**Specific Attack Examples (Initial Focus):**
- **CV:** FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method), PGD (Projected Gradient Descent), Carlini-Wagner, DeepFool.
- **NLP:** TextFooler, BERT-Attack, HotFlip, Synonym Replacement.
- **Time Series:** Adversarial noise injection, sequence manipulation.

## 4. Technology Stack

To achieve scalability, flexibility, and performance, the following core technologies will be utilized:

- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (Python) - For high-performance APIs, asynchronous operations, and automatic OpenAPI documentation.
- **AI/ML Frameworks:** PyTorch / TensorFlow - For building, loading, and performing inference on AI models, and for implementing attacks.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL - For structured data (model metadata, user info, attack configurations, results summaries).
- **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ / Kafka - For asynchronous task processing, especially for long-running attack simulations.
- **Containerization:** Docker.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s) - For deploying, scaling, and managing microservices in a cloud-agnostic manner.
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (with potential for multi-cloud abstraction) - Leveraging services like EKS, S3, RDS, SQS/SNS.
- **Frontend Framework:** React (TypeScript) - For a modern, interactive, and responsive user interface.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions - For automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) - For observability and operational insights.
- **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

## 6. Security Considerations

Security will be a foundational pillar, integrated throughout the development lifecycle (Security by Design). Key aspects include:

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Robust identity management, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
- **Data Protection:** Encryption at rest and in transit, strict access controls for sensitive data (models, datasets, results).
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Preventing common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, RCE) and adversarial inputs at the application layer.
- **Network Security:** VPCs, Subnets, Security Groups/Network ACLs, Kubernetes Network Policies.
- **Secret Management:** Secure handling of API keys, database credentials, etc. (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
- **Container Security:** Image scanning, least privilege containers.
- **Incident Response:** Clear procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.

## 7. Performance Targets

- **API Latency:** Sub-100ms for routine operations (model lookup, simple prediction).
- **Attack Generation:** Optimized for speed, utilizing GPUs where applicable. Provide estimates for attack duration based on complexity.
- **Scalability:** Ability to handle hundreds of concurrent attack simulations and thousands of prediction requests per second.
- **Throughput:** High data processing rates for large datasets and models.

## 8. Development Workflow

- **Git-based workflow:** Feature branches, pull requests, code reviews.
- **Automated Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests integrated into CI/CD.
- **Container-first development:** Build and test services within Docker containers.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage cloud resources and Kubernetes configurations using tools like Terraform/Pulumi.

This architecture overview provides a clear roadmap for building a professional-grade AI Adversarial Sandbox.
